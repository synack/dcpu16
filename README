A C based implementation of Notch's DCPU-16, written for the fun of it.

See: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

Why: I enjoy hacking on small machines, virtual or otherwise, and I'm
     amused by the concept of a space game with user programmable
     virtual computer(s).  

     Consider this a piece of "fan art" for 0x10c

     Feel free to take it and run with it and do whatever you like.

     Small bugfixes are welcome, but I'm not interested in investing a 
     huge amount of time in maintaining this or dealing with large changes 
     to the code.
